Interface :
Interface is used in situation, when we need to restrict derived class to implements all methods. 
This can be done by making abstract class with all abstract methods, then why use interface? 
The answer is, a class can inherit only one class at a time but a class can implement more than one interface 
at a time along with another class.

Abstract:
Abstract class is used in situation, when we have partial set of implementation of methods in a class. 
For example, consider a class have four methods. Out of four methods, we have an implementation of two methods 
and we need to restrict derived class to implement other two methods. In these kind of situations, we should use abstract class.
