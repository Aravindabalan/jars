**
 * Interface must be declare with interface keyword.
 * Like abstract class, we can't create an object of abstract class.
 * All methods in interface are public and abstract.
 * We must implement all method in derived class.
 * A class can inherit interface using implements keyword.

 /** An interface is a blueprint of a class, it can have methods and variables like a class but methods 
 * declared in a interface will be by default abstract(only declaration no body) and the variables declared 
 * will be public, static & final by default.
